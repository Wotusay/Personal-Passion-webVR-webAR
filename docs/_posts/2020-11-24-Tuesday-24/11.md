An log where i write what i did

## What did i do?

Today i made it posible to move objects with your controllers and added some physics in the mix. This worked out great but i had some problems with combining costum components with each other. But after some searching on stackoverflow it worked out great. 

The issue was that i couldnt grap the item when there was an dynamic body on it, i could resize it but moving it was a problem. The fix was that the framework didnt know when things were coliding each other wich was needed to know when u grab something. 

The fix for it:
[Stackoverflow fix](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64902347/aframe-problem-with-physics-dynamic-body-grabbable)

The libaries i used for all these elemenst where: 
[Physics system ](https://github.com/n5ro/aframe-physics-system)
[Super hands ](https://github.com/wmurphyrd/aframe-super-hands-component)

## For tomorrow

tomorrow i will create a simple ui element to spawn items and to place them where ever u want in the room. And if there is time left ill make a little basket ball game or something like wise.
