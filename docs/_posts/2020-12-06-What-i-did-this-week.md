## First off all

This was trying to fix some bugs form the open-source libary that i use for the connection between players. The bugs i had were: randomly spawn in the ground, can't see eachother after the owner disconnectes. 

I fixed the most of these bugs but this took a long time to figure out how they are there in first place. After the bugs i made an random location spawner and a body to help players determine where others are. 

## The new revamped room

After finding out some of the bugs, i didnt find any more inspiration for the rooms. So i decided to revamp the room in something more personal and more apealing for everyone. And that isnt resource heavy. 

The room evovled in a full on park where people can hangout and chill with eachother. And im planning to add some more easter eggs in the next week wich u can pick up and place some where else to show other your findings. All the models are made with the a-frame editor and html. I didnt touch any third party software for models. This was a time consuming process but i find it more fitting. 

## The new welcome screen!

Im making a menu screen wich u can easy visit public rooms and u dont have to type anything to make a private room to hangout alone with some one. The rooms are all the same but are like lobbies to hangout. 

Im still working on the private rooms. On how to get the input code into the room attribute. 

## Last of all

Im still planning to add some off customisation to the charater to make it more personal. 
And add more easter eggs and help other players to get more out of their vr expierence in the park. And make a beautifull case movie for my work.
