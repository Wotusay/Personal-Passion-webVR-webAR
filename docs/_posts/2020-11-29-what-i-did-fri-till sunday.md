## The Friday. 

On this day i worked on the online section oof my app. I used webrtc to connect users in realtime. Here i made posible thatt users can see each othere move and rotate. This took a bit of time but eventualy i made i posible. i made a little demo where other users can see each other.


## The Saturday. 

On this day i transferd all the knowledge to my own project. But there were some bugs with the hands not displaying in real time for dekstop users. i looked a the source code of aframes hand component to learn how the animations work and when they are called. 

## The Sunday.
On this day i made the hands work in realtime and it worked. I added some event listeners to the project to listen wich events trigger the hand movement. Then i changed some thing for performence for the hands. I made my first live demo with heroku and deployed it live. I used this to test it with my friends to see if the hands are really working. I added voicechat and some diffrent colors to make a differnce between players.

## Whats next?

I will add more activities / add the posibillty to costumize the room with their friends. And add some more neat ui elements.
